- I'm currently working as a software engineer, designing databases, and creating data ingestion pipelines.
- I’m interested in improving my backend development skills, building secure applications, and (eventually) bug bounty.
- I’m currently learning back-end development, secure coding, and infosec basics.
- I'm doing this through my daily work, practicing python with [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives), taking [We Hack Purple](https://wehackpurple.com/)'s Secure Coding Course, and doing learning paths on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities#learning-paths).
- I’m looking to collaborate on database design and management.
